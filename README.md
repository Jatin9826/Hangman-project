"This is a Hangman game implemented in Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list and prompts the player to guess letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn, adding suspense to the game. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. The game provides visual feedback using ASCII art to represent the hangman's stages. This project showcases basic Python programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and lists. It offers an interactive and fun way to practice Python skills while enjoying a classic word-guessing game."
